    blurb: `<p>I first had the idea for the facets series of poems in January 2000, produced first drafts fit for criticism in March 2000, and continued to revise and review over the following months. Final drafts started to be produced late in 2000, with the last poem completed (if these things can ever be “completed”) in May 2001.</p><p>I could not have honed these poems without the helpful advice and critiques of a large group of regulars (you know who you are!) over the past year and a bit, in particular from the rec.arts.poems and alt.arts.poetry.comments newsgroups, and from the pffa and Gazebo discussion boards – thanks, peoples, for putting up with me and my old man for sooo long!</p>`,

Well, that’s not strictly true as I uploaded the pdf file to the website some time after releasing 22 Facets of my Father into the wild, but that was more of a poetry sequence than a collection of poems, so this is my first proper collection.</p><p>These 22 poems are some of my earlier work, from the poems that survived the post-puberty bonfire up to around the turn of the century. There’s no over-arching theme to the poems as such, but if you look carefully you’ll be able to spot the various experiments and approaches I was trying at the time.</p>`,
