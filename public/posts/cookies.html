<p>The RikVerse website does not load - or let any third party (PayPal, Facebook, Twitter) load - any cookies when it first appears into your browser. For this reason, you won't see one of those annoying cookie banners pop up on the site.</p>

<p>But let's be honest here. <b>The RikVerse is much more exciting when you add some cookies to the mix!</b></p>

<p class='text-center'><a href='/cookies' class='text-xl'>Manage your cookie choices on the Cookies page.</a></p>

<h3>Sharing pages to Facebook and/or Twitter</h3>

<p>Social media share buttons are disabled by default, and the RikVerse site will not allow <b>Facebook</b> or <b>Twitter</b> to pollute these pages with their code until after you have agreed to consume these delicious 3rd Party Cookies in the cookies page.</p>

<h3>Donating some money to Rik to help keep this site running for $FREE</h3>

<p>There's a (small and discrete) <b>PayPal donate button</b> in the footer of every RikVerse page. Should you ever feel the need to click on that button you may be redirected to the cookies page and invited to let those nice, kind people at PayPal add a couple of cookies to your browser/device.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself moved to making a donation - Thank You!</p>

<h3>Adjusting your cookie preferences</h3>

<p>You can update your cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the <a href='/cookies'>Cookies</a> links on the right hand side of the top and bottom navigation bars.</p>

<p>Also: <b>thank you for reading this cookie policy</b>. You are - literally! - One In A Million!</p>
