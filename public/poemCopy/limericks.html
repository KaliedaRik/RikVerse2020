<p>I've decided to collect all my limericks in one place, so the Archive doesn't get too cluttered. Enjoy!</p>

<hr class='mb-4'/>

<p class='italic'>These ones were committed as part of my NaPoWriMo 2005 challenge. It might be worth my while doing a complete Table of limerick elements, even if others have already done something the same or similar - I'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Mercury Meeps from Mosul<br />
Owned an old boat with no hull<br />
When asked: do you sail<br />
In that boat, or just bail?<br />
He said: I prefer just to scull.</p>

<p>Arsenic Angie from York<br />
Murdered her man with a fork:<br />
Though her stab missed his heart<br />
She succeeded in part<br />
By using the tines as a torque</p>

<p>Gallium Gordon from Tring<br />
Chose to deport all his bling:<br />
When sent down by the beak<br />
For crimes against chic<br />
He screamed: I'll not wear prison string!</p>

<p class='italic'>I made the following post to rec.arts.poems on 17 August 2004 under the title "Olympic challenge: formation limericks". The resultant deluge of limericks were far better than my own initial challenge limerick! The whole thread can be found on [link redacted]</p>

<p>The Olympic games aren't only supposed to be about sport. They're supposed to be about culture too, and in some of the early modern Olympics medals were awarded for artistic endeavour.</p>

<p>I think rap should resurrect this sort of thing. So I'm hereby challenging posters and poets, trolls and poetasters, and even lurkers to post a <b>limerick</b> - the best limerick shall win the laurels, etc. </p>

<p>(We can decide on how to score the entries later, if we bother to score them at all - remember it's the taking part bit that's supposed to be important).</p>

<p>All competitors should approach the starting line, which is:</p>

<p class='ml-6'>"There was a [adjective] [man/woman/boy/girl/goat] from [a place in Greece]"</p>

<p>May the best entries entertain us all! To start the ball rolling, here's my entry:</p>

<p>There was an grey goat from Salonica<br />
Who wanted to learn the harmonica.<br />
He asked the fat man:<br />
"Can you teach this old ram<br />
To play some sweet songs of Olympia."</p>

<p class='italic'>More limericks, this time committed in the name of NaPoWriMo 2006:</p>

<p>Ms Carbon Kelly from Crewe<br />
wanted a Turn of the Screw;<br />
she went to the theatre<br />
for a show that would cheer her<br />
but ended up locked in the loo!</p>

<p>Oxygen Oz from Oxtead<br />
suffered from visions of dead<br />
ghosts who would sing<br />
old songs and dour hymns<br />
when he tried to seduce his guests.</p>

<p>Helium Hattie from Hull<br />
once tried to cook a seagull:<br />
she stuffed it with vines<br />
and poached it in wine<br />
then choked on its egg-like skull.</p>

<p>Flourine Flossie from Frome<br />
liked the glamour of chrome<br />
she did up her halls<br />
with metal baubles<br />
that glowed at the height of a storm.</p>

<p class='italic'>The 2008 NaPoWriMo batch:</p>

<p><b>The LimerRik</b><br />
There was an old chicken called Rik<br />
Who sat on his nest with a stick.<br />
Each day he would lay<br />
an egg, which would say<br />
'If you think I'm a poem, you're thick!'</p>

<hr class='mb-4'/>

<p class='italic'>The 2009 NaPoWriMo batch:</p>

<p>Vanadium Vera has ticks<br />
she counts them by bites, and licks<br />
each blood-laden ball<br />
as it lets go to fall<br />
to the carpet, for stamping to bits.</p>

<p>Roger has radon hair:<br />
it glows when he goes to the fair<br />
to ride on the dodgems<br />
and slide on the dog-ends<br />
and vomit that veneers the stairs.</p>

<p>Hafnium Hettie does huff<br />
when she clomps down the stairs for a puff<br />
on her Marlboro Light -<br />
each suck a delight<br />
of poisons and tars and stuff</p>

<p>A lady called Chromium Kate<br />
delights in the search for a mate:<br />
she hunts down her man<br />
and does what she can,<br />
then marks up one more on her slate.</p>

<p>Rubidium Ronnie has form;<br />
his bones are immune to reform:<br />
each night he must shake<br />
his tackle, and make<br />
the women of Romford perform.</p>
