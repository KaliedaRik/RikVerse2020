<p>It's like a boil, this need to write &mdash;<br />
a pulsed heat set at the back of my skull<br />
that compels phrases to form and dance</p>

<p>in patterns: cadenced hopes, a catenate <br />
of murmers at the threshhold of meaning<br />
beyond their means; blastocyte verses &mdash;</p>

<p>I shall lance that urge now, watch words<br />
spurt too soon from the pock-wound, reach<br />
ears before their time &mdash; oh, sweet relief!</p>
