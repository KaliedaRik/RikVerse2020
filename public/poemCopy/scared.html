<p>When the angels came to take the world<br />
across the universe to heaven,<br />
I heard a familiar trumpet blown<br />
&mdash; softly, not quite off-key &mdash;<br />
as I crouched in my quilted bed alone.</p>

<p>When the dancers of death recalled the winds<br />
out from the bellows that blew them,<br />
I smelt remnants, the faintest taint<br />
of cheap cologne at the top of the stairs,<br />
and shook.</p>

<p>When the sons and daughters of Flamer Jack<br />
crowded the porch to proclaim the departure<br />
of one I had tried not to love,<br />
my eyes burned reflections of their swaying flames<br />
&mdash; and I cried.</p>

<p>It was not a father's pulse that failed:<br />
rather a slice of my Breath. Yet sometimes &mdash;<br />
when the precious clock strikes, when winter comes,<br />
when I sense cheap cologne by my side &mdash;<br />
I know he is there,</p>

<p>and I learn once more my muscled Breath<br />
and my Breath that is stopped<br />
must stay sundered a while longer yet.<br />
The lesson hurts me: it burns me.<br />
And still I am scared of the wound.</p>
