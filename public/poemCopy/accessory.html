<p>Such a stupid hat.<br />
Not you, the way it falls<br />
across your eyes, the brim<br />
sieving dust mites;<br />
a swatch of orange<br />
without feathers<br />
&mdash; felt, maybe,<br />
or shoddy.</p>

<p>So many rags and snags<br />
rolled tight to fit<br />
in this cupboard.</p>

<p>Dress up for me.<br />
Let fall your hat, your shirt &mdash;<br />
wear me, tonight, my supple<br />
leather laced tight<br />
to you.</p>
