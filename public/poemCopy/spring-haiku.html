<p>The arch of the branch<br />
drips dew from bud to crocus:<br />
the swallow shivers.</p>

<p>This waterfall roars &mdash;<br />
lions released from the depths<br />
hunt amid the spray.</p>

<p>Mud on my fingers<br />
crumbles to beads as it dries:<br />
seeds mixed with dead skin.</p>

<p>Crowds in the high street &mdash;<br />
shoes clomping across concrete:<br />
weeds huddle in cracks.</p>

<p>The first bee wanders,<br />
a cold flight through frosty air:<br />
spring will bloom next week.</p>
