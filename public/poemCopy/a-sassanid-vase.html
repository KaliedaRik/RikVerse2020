<p>Within its clear lattice, a history of hands:<br />
a man in deep places, stroking veins.</p>

<p>An artisan hollows its ice-warm frame.<br />
With the spin of a drill he sees his God</p>

<p>in honeycombs; a bulb forms to pull venom<br />
from poisons. Many hands pass. Poor Eleanor,</p>

<p>a new orphan, gifts it to her prince - her hand<br />
shakes a flake of radiance from its golden flue.</p>

<p>Hands slap to heads as it chimes the floor.<br />
A fresh net of cracks celebrates its gravitas.</p>
