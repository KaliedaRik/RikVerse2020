<p class="italic">"Do you believe in destiny?"</p>

<p>He's old, this one, blind<br />
as he walks in the steps<br />
of a child. His breath<br />
smells sweet, brandy in flame; <br />
his lungs buzz. I shake my head &mdash;</p>

<p class="italic">"We are what we do, no more."</p>

<p>He laughs. <i>"A harsh judgement<br />
you place on my back; I have killed<br />
many men. A child of the sun<br />
can do no more than follow<br />
the knots embraided in his hair."</i></p>

<p class="italic">"I have no comb to change you!"</p>

<p>He knocks bills from the desk<br />
as he leans to my face: I see<br />
midnight enthroned in sockets.<br />
<i>"I chose to push the pillars,"</i><br />
he says, <i>"cascade that stony sky &mdash;</i></p>

<p class="italic">"I am a good judge. Are you?"</p>
