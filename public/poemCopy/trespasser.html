<p>My Gran, she warned me of you:<br />
<i>'an absence of a man'</i>, she said. <i>'A taker<br />
of breath and life'</i>. And here you are<br />
outlined at my door. <i>Back away</i>,</p>

<p>I think. <i>Jump!</i> My legs don't shift.<br />
They lie in sheets, slack meat strung<br />
on hingeless bones. <i>Wake up</i> &mdash; but I'm not<br />
asleep. My hands won't lift. I sweat</p>

<p>as you trespass, my breath lung-tight.<br />
You come near, a wireframe face skinned<br />
in shadows. <i>'This death is a bastard'</i>,<br />
Gran told. Your hands touch my chest</p>

<p>and press down hard, the weight a stroke<br />
of pain, a stripe of fire along my arm.<br />
You grin a question: <i>"do you want me?"</i></p>

<p class='ml-6'><i>Yes</i>, I agree. <i>You I can love</i>.</p>

<p>You freeze; your lips &mdash; so close &mdash; crack.<br />
My hand grasps your head as you collapse,<br />
a slow avalanche of skin and hair. Bone<br />
arcs across the room, flakes and breaks</p>

<p>down to the knots of the carpet tufts.<br />
I heave cold air inside my ribs, consume it.<br />
Snarl it out. Jabs and stabs grief my arm</p>

<p>as I turn and clasp my lover tight, claim<br />
his sweat, his traffic-in-the-distance<br />
snores.</p>
