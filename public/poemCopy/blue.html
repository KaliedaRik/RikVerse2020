<p>I don't see emotions <br />
when I write blue. <br />
I don't feel the dampness <br />
of waves across my instep, <br />
nor taste the sprays <br />
of kicked water, nor hear <br />
the insults, nor shudder <br />
at the touch of the pulsing <br />
plastic bag driven by currents <br />
to wrap its inert tentacle <br />
strips across my knee. <br />
There is no sunny heat <br />
in these tinted images.</p>

<p>Sometimes the pendular tap <br />
of the waves on my ear <br />
can bring tears to finger <br />
their tide across my cheek, <br />
but I don't see emotions <br />
when I write blue. <br />
This shade of indignity<br />
lies hidden in the chord <br />
of melody, the growl<br />
of the throaty trumpet<br />
planted in my chest. I test<br />
each keyboard button<br />
between knuckle snaps,<br />
type the word: blue.</p>
