<p>He knows the mirror lies.</p>

<p>It lied when he was six,<br />
refused to catch the ghosts</p>

<p>who whispered in his ear<br />
within its spattered frame.</p>

<p>It lied when he was ten,<br />
taking its time to draw</p>

<p>the bruises on his face<br />
he'd earned in playground brawls.</p>

<p>It lied last night. It placed<br />
the tears within her eyes</p>

<p>when there were none. Her smile<br />
did not translate. He knows</p>

<p>this mirror lies: it shows<br />
a stranger's life to him.</p>

<p>It curses him, this plane<br />
of gilt and long regard.</p>

<p>He knows the mirror lies.</p>
