<p class='mb-0'>The quazikov can score you points</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>when placed upon the board,<br />
but challenges come thick and fast<br />
from people poorly taught</p>
<p class='mb-0'>about the beasts of Barkonleigh</p>
<p class='ml-6'>that roam around at night<br />
and eat the fruit of gamgam trees<br />
while staying out of sight.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>The trial of Lingus Mascabee</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>took sixteen days and nights:<br />
the prosecuter told the tale<br />
of robbers wearing tights;</p>
<p class='mb-0'>then Lingus stood and showed the court</p>
<p class='ml-6'>it wasn't him because<br />
he only had one leg &mdash; and that<br />
was close to being lost.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Twenty men climbed up the hill</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>to court the Maids of Skip &mdash;<br />
they read them screeds of poetry,<br />
they fed them meruslip;</p>
<p class='mb-0'>they led them by the hands on walks</p>
<p class='ml-6'>across the cabbage fields<br />
where the Maids of Skip stabbed the men<br />
and burned them with their shields.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>This football game is boring us:</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>we want to see some skills!<br />
We want to see the home team score<br />
a barrow-load of goals!</p>
<p class='mb-0'>We want to see the referee</p>
<p class='ml-6'>regain his mind and sight<br />
and then we want to drink some beer<br />
and sing and puke and fight!</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Malley was a carpenter:</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>he built himself a chair<br />
and set it up upon his roof<br />
where he could sit and stare</p>
<p class='mb-0'>at people rushing to and fro</p>
<p class='ml-6'>with screams and cries of fear<br />
while Malley shot them with his gun<br />
and lanced them with his spear.</p>
