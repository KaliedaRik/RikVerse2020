<p>She has the prim hips of one<br />
who makes her own bread daily;<br />
her sockets are fresh petals<br />
around a brined curl of pearl.</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>"A husband's curse is a heavy burden:<br />
it weighs on the womb like idols."</p>

<p>She keeps a goat-wool scarf tied<br />
taut across the brow as I pour<br />
whisky as blended as incests &mdash;<br />
she refuses with a smile to tempt<br />
an offer of long labour, gratis.</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>"I lost sight of him on the Efrat road;<br />
a good man, worthy of sororital love."</p>

<p>Her white glance speaks of tombs<br />
and dust, birth-killed bones lost<br />
between steads; her sumac breath<br />
shows a devotion for hearths.</p>

<p class='ml-6 italic'>"He took my miracles, my desert fruits &mdash;<br />
Atonement comes, and I must hug them."</p>
