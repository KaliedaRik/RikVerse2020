<p>This image is as dead as the hand<br />
that detailed it, drowned by fire.</p>

<p>Flames erupt from the starbursts:<br />
they lick the scene, as if a tongue</p>

<p>has pointed each petal onto canvas.<br />
Leaves, too, jag and drip in frames.</p>

<p>A window breaks onto the vase.<br />
A friend could sit by that view</p>

<p>and swallow sunshine whole,<br />
each seed toothed from its husk.</p>
