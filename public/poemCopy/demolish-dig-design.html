<p class='ml-6 italic'>(following the discovery of iron age remains <br />
at the site of the 2012 Olympic Park, Stratford)</p>

<p>Each day a fresh terrain: dirt-yellow ants<br />
bite through soils, their tracked mandibles<br />
levelling hills, shaping plains to make<br />
a new thing &mdash; a venue; a stage; a belief.</p>

<p>One lifts a sod, lets sunshine pitch<br />
through a skull's orbit &mdash; the world<br />
had spun our star three thousand times<br />
since this bone's last East End breath.</p>

<p>Mighty legends shall erupt from the land,<br />
the hoardings say, once waste is cleared &mdash;<br />
derelicts razed, bricks recycled, hopes renewed.<br />
Great dreams must lance from fresh skulls.</p>
