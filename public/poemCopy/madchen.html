<p>She is, above all, a drama of curves<br />
caught in the tooth. A finger's trophy,</p>

<p>she maps the wills of our sires and dams<br />
in fragments, the mistress of a circus</p>

<p>whose beasts roar and rut in silence -<br />
shall daylight humble her, and the measure </p>

<p>of each of her arcs and scars strip apart <br />
the last of our homeless, hidden humanity?</p>

<p>Her caverns host no mysteries any more,<br />
and the stars in her heavens are gone.</p>
