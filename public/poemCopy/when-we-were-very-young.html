<p class='font-mono'>&gt; &gt; The first posts a starting line.<br />
&gt; &gt; Another adds a cheesy rhyme<br />
&gt; &gt; ... a day passes for the third to arrive.<br />
&gt; &gt; Then a flurry<br />
&gt; (flurry - is tht a pussy werd)<br />
(Torll alert! Learn to spell, fuckwit!)<br />
&gt; &gt; of shortworm phrases -<br />
&gt; &gt; watch the modem steam<br />
&gt; (Scream? Flame?)<br />
(steam rhymes with turd, lol)<br />
&gt; &gt; at the stream<br />
&gt; (Really? That rhyme would shame McGonagall!)<br />
&gt; &gt; of verse-scraps threaded into the pile.<br />
&gt; We need to interrupt this reminiscence for a dissertation<br />
&gt; on the importance of McGonagall to the development<br />
&gt; of English verse, as after that man achieved publication<br />
&gt; the only avenue left for poets to explore was freestyle<br />
&gt; strophe acrobats, and an ongoing attempt to obliterate<br />
&gt; dactyls with big white space.<br />
(lol yr mom fuks kiddies!)<br />
&gt; &gt; I never made it<br />
&gt; &gt; to BareIt ...<br />
