<p>They say it takes a thief to catch<br />
a diamond: the stone I seek should spark<br />
like a resurrection ... but not in this city<br />
of parvenu panhandlers, too busy skimming<br />
the cream to sniff the shit they sit in. My thief</p>

<p>sits in a tap room, ant-addled beams akimbo;<br />
he does not enjoy the rough scrub of wood<br />
across his skin. I oil him in gin to part his lips:<br />
"You know where he is?" He has a long smile<br />
and a longer nod - "I seen him around. He peeps</p>

<p>through the holes in his hands, that one,<br />
not keen to keep his promises. But I knows<br />
him well, his smells and shakes. He shares<br />
my name now innit. He cared for the world<br />
too long; his screams is lost from his voice."</p>
