<p class='mb-0'>Beyond Stratford station's rust fence,<br />
a field in plough: farrow and till &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>ripe for seeding.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>The warehouses have been folded away<br />
so architectures can set root, bed down &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>glass petal, steel stem.</p>

their spoilheaps a sawtooth horizon &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>brown, bare.</p>

each change daily; today, a ground frost &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>sods snap in the ice.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Men in plastic hats check their vision<br />
against clipboard bibles: origami maps &mdash;</p>
