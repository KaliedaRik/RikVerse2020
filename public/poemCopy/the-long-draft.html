<p class='font-mono whitespace-pre-wrap'>   Did you hear<br />
    how they built<br />
      a chimney<br />
      that reached up<br />
        to prick the shawl<br />
      of the sky, high<br />
      like the flight<br />
    of rockets, geese<br />
    and heroes.<br />
  They wanted<br />
  to shout at<br />
  God, you see,<br />
    make sure He<br />
      heard their praise.<br />
      On each brick,<br />
    a signature<br />
      penned by a<br />
      penitent<br />
      keen to book<br />
      a cushion stool<br />
        of thunderclouds<br />
          to witness<br />
          the world's end.<br />
            That chimney rose<br />
          so high the stars<br />
          themselves dodged<br />
          the hum of songs<br />
            birthed, evolved<br />
            and dead within<br />
              its long throat.<br />
              Many roasted<br />
            on the hearth,<br />
          their oiled smoke<br />
          caught on the flue.<br />
        Did I buy<br />
        a brick? Yes,<br />
      an orange one,<br />
      as flaked as<br />
      the ones that held<br />
    my grandmother<br />
  beneath her roof;<br />
  But I didn't like<br />
    the pointing, and<br />
    their choice of mortar<br />
        was shoddy.</p>
