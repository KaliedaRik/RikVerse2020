<p>They, the Authorities, the ones who know<br />
better than we could ever believe<br />
what hurts us, have deemed that colours can kill.<br />
I am not to be trusted to select a death<br />
based on the shine of its cardboard wrap.<br />
Instead I must challenge the counter staff<br />
to guess at my choice: this pack or that?<br />
Who knows? The letters that brand the box<br />
get dwarfed by the art of coffins, of a kid<br />
who chokes on the smoke his mama blows<br />
- the autopsy slab glints in its chromes -<br />
and yet amid the warning notes<br />
the largest is stark: 'duty paid'.<br />
And the colour They, the Authorities, chose<br />
to stop me from buying my nicotine fix<br />
(opaque couch&eacute; - a pretty name)<br />
trends on the streets of Hipster Shoreditch<br />
in trainers and joggers: <i>... and so it goes</i>.</p>
