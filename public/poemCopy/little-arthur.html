<p>Now the spore has touched the ant<br />
it must sprout and down its steed:</p>

<p>white threads needle over barding;<br />
sharp tips lance the pauldron gaps.</p>

<p>Once in, it knits itself a new flesh<br />
between the silks of muscle and fat.</p>

<p>A ring of barbs crowns the head<br />
beneath the bascinet, to rule the beast.</p>

<p>Come dawn, an ant clambers the length<br />
of a long stalk to view its domain;</p>

<p>it lifts the belly to salute the crowds<br />
scurrying below, servicing the realm.</p>

<p>When the grail erupts from the armour<br />
spores shower down: Camelot blooms.</p>
