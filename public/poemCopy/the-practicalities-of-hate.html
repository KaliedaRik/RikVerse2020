<p>It has been eight days since the fact<br />
of the ballot came to roost in the eaves<br />
of our homes; still we disbelieve. Which<br />
neighbour cheered this act? Which sibling?</p>

<p>Those stories we told each other? They are<br />
lies. We are not modern, nor progressive. We<br />
are base; we are dirty. We hate, just as those<br />
who chose otherwise seem to us to loathe the<br />
world beyond our shores. Such a heady new<br />
feeling! It takes our thoughts and mouths, feeds<br />
them a gut-brewed bile so we can poison words -</p>

<p>lazy, witless, unthinking sheep happy to vote<br />
as the headlines command them, keen to cast<br />
that first stone at each new day's enemy ...<br />
this is my future too? Tatters of the dream<br />
that was once my England flap in the gutter;<br />
I will not wait for the next summer storm to wash<br />
the streets clean: I have a brick in my hand.</p>
