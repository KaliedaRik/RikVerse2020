<p>For my first burlesque of the season<br />
I seek an audience of crows; there is much<br />
for me to expose and, when done, they caw<br />
an appreciation. I lumber onto my back<br />
and let Aten's fingers massage me:<br />
<i>you've fattened well,</i> the lost god<br />
whispers; <i>I accept your singe of a gift.</i></p>
