<p>My goose hisses as I walk the length<br />
of the identity parade. The bespoke<br />
suits of potential criminals crease<br />
as each identikit man reaches in turn<br />
to pet the witness; it eyes their ties<br />
&mdash; colour coded gang tags &mdash; and rattles<br />
its tongue in its beak as they tweak<br />
at its tail. For this is the choice:<br />
the spiv who plucks most feathers<br />
with the least noise shall win<br />
my harlot head on their pillow.</p>
