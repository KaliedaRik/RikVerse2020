<p class='mb-0'>Flaw sits in my cupboards<br />
Flaw stands behind doors<br />
Flaw hides in the curtains</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>whittling its claws.</p>
<p class='mb-0'>Flaw smirks in my mirrors<br />
Flaw shadows my back<br />
Flaw skips in my nightmares &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>it has that knack.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Flaw crumples my clothing<br />
Flaw stains my best sheets<br />
Flaw spits when I'm hungry</p>
<p class='mb-0 ml-6'>and still I eat.</p>
<p class='mb-0'>Flaw plagues my horizons<br />
Flaw makes you all see<br />
that Flaw is my partner &mdash;</p>
<p class='ml-6'>a true part of me.</p>
