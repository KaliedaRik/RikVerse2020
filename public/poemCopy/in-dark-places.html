<p>Cold in the ice &mdash; sparkles on needles<br />
shaken as chips skip from the trunk,<br />
resin-scent curls moulting: a death<br />
of seasons. That axe is treasured.<br />
Old wood slots within the steel that lops<br />
root from bole, warming the hands<br />
that swirl it in arcs through air<br />
as brittle as decorations.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>Good will requires flames, a heap<br />
of amber tongues licking goose meat<br />
turned in lines over the stony pit.</p>

<p>We are in dark places, my love.<br />
We can sit knee to hip and wait<br />
beneath our stencilled angels &mdash;<br />
but he won't come. He has no trust<br />
in scratch-mark wings or cold hearths.<br />
Still, I treasure these bricks, know:<br />
our darkness has warmth, a comfort<br />
of arms and dry cloth for the wrapping.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>A stew needs more than one bean<br />
to thicken the broth. We could plant it,<br />
climb high and sleep in his beard tonight.</p>

<p>I bought you a present, wrapped<br />
in scraps as torn as pockets. It is<br />
&mdash; a bribe, I suppose, a new axe &mdash;<br />
its shiny shape caught my eyes<br />
like decorations dangled from boughs.<br />
You can keep it by the door, if you like,<br />
or hung on the wall where our fire burned<br />
before I bricked it away, for safety.</p>
