<p>You snatched me back in ninety three,<br />
a crook-toothed smile spun through dim light<br />
to hook my eyes, a scatter of laughs and limbs<br />
lanky in jeans and tee &mdash; not my type<br />
at all and yet, and yet</p>

<p>here we are, somehow, boxed together<br />
so hard by that life we built I dare not guess<br />
where you end, I start &mdash; a melt of cheese<br />
over toast, cream and crunch, a shrine<br />
to sated lusts and still, and still &mdash;</p>
