<p>He said: <i>"love is<br />
a sport of both skill<br />
and chance, strategic<br />
planning must become your<br />
core competence."</i></p>

<p>I said: <i>"why render these chemicals<br />
into a game?"</i></p>

<p>He said: <i>"you have to<br />
compete, my friend."</i></p>

<p>I said: nothing. I watched his tongue<br />
moisten his underlip, a quick slither<br />
of spittle between words to gloss<br />
his looks. He smelt of sharp spices.<br />
I watched him cock his head, his eyes<br />
remained symmetrical, blue &mdash; electrodes<br />
pushed through my forehead. I watched<br />
his throat form thoughts &mdash; a rhythmic<br />
rise and close, rise and close.<br />
Curled hairs caressed his larynx.</p>

<p>He said, oh,<br />
something or other.<br />
I wasn't listening.</p>
