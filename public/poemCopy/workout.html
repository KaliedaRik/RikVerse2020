<p>Health &mdash; an exercise<br />
in barrenness; a factory,<br />
a fair of pain hid beneath<br />
Victoria's ice-sweat streets.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>We stretch and lift<br />
in rows, video-plugged.</p>

<p>Music, heartbeats &mdash;<br />
count the numbers, chart<br />
some lines; programmes pre-set,<br />
static conveyors to fitness.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>Compete! A second less,<br />
a kilo more, beat them!</p>

<p>Bulbs searchlight the park,<br />
their beams stretch limbs &mdash; alien,<br />
tangled branches, paths. I gasp,<br />
hard breaths; heels lift and reach.</p>

<p class='ml-6'>This is our game: to chase,<br />
to lap; to catch fat geese.</p>

<p>I am a new merchant.<br />
I trade endorphins, blood<br />
to brain, an addict; a lover:<br />
glory comes to those who strive!</p>
