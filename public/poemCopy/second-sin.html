<p>He brings a harsh heat into the room;<br />
stones among sand: "You see me?"</p>

<p>I nod, reach for the warm whisky<br />
as he hunches down on the chair<br />
with the snapped back, almond mouth<br />
bitter within its shallow beard.</p>

<p>He says: "I need a vengeance. My grave<br />
has room for another, a brother<br />
to lie in his furrow by my bones.<br />
I can pay you in camels, or goats."</p>

<p>The sun in my dull mirror, it hangs<br />
off the broken window, bloods clouds,<br />
marks a fall. From the street, a shout;<br />
a coil of flamed headline; the bark<br />
of a car. "Am I your brother's seeker?"</p>

<p>"These are good camels," he smiles,<br />
"keen in the snout for water."</p>
