<p>Fish scales blue as chop sea<br />
scraped on tables, gut-knots<br />
knocked to the sod for dogs<br />
and cats and white gulls.</p>

<p>She smiles large as waves<br />
caught on evening huffs<br />
of breeze: <i>"You need good<br />
macaroni pie go wid de cutter,<br />
mister, put some flesh <br />
on dose bones. Hah! No bounce<br />
in you, skinny as de fish<br />
in de bun like I make for you!"</i></p>

<p>Gulls and cats and shouts and dogs<br />
and cheap white chairs in dust <br />
wet from washed trestles;<br />
the guts of the sun in the sea.</p>

<p>And dark, so quick. A growl<br />
of diesel, here, and here, here<br />
and lights on lines round sheds.<br />
<i>"You stay a while, skinny man<br />
and we do some dancing, hah,<br />
you de fish and me de cutter<br />
catch your bones in my buns<br />
washed down with good rum, yes?"</i></p>

<p>Nets on poles shine in lights;<br />
spouge plays on decks, new words<br />
on old beats fresh-caught today;<br />
spice grog with conch and lime.</p>
