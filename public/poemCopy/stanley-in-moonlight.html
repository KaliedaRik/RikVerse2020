<p>He lopes slow-motioned, each foot-stride <br />
matched by the see-saw dance of shoulders<br />
humping over his nape. He keeps his ears</p>

<p>pert: black tips scanning tufts and twig-tumbles<br />
for scuffles, vole-squeak. The morsels whistle<br />
warnings ahead of his thoughtless trek &mdash;</p>

<p>then silence. Odour sources tangle colour<br />
through his grey-tone bush-scapes. He sits,<br />
sniffs his tail-pit tag glands, tongues clean</p>

<p>his fur-pursed wolf-hood: still the gift-disk shines.<br />
When he howls, his bones recall the loss, the pain<br />
of change, complexity; the moult of flesh.</p>
