<p>This year autumn arrives in August:  <br />
blows shit-shaded leaves past my head, <br />
under my feet &mdash; scrunch-muffled in the rain. <br />
Damp rots the fruit in the market, rusts <br />
trolleys abandoned in the street. </p>

<p class='ml-6'>Skin chills. I daydream hibernation. </p>

<p>The colours of autumn are not rich: <br />
they are tweeds misted in drizzle, functions <br />
of an attar-trap rapping my windows, tapping <br />
my gutters. My pity renounces wars, victims, <br />
tips reflexive. Turns to self. </p>

<p class='ml-6'>Dreams are forfeit. I cannot fight seasons. </p>

<p>Pity drips like fetid catarrh, drops <br />
from nostril to tea mug, gets sipped, swilled <br />
into the maw, swallowed. Drizzle stipples windows <br />
whittling colours from my view: greying bricks <br />
in my walls, thoughts in my head. </p>

<p class='ml-6'>A hand writes. Monochromes scream.</p>
