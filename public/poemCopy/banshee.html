<p class='mb-0'>She dabs his hot form<br />
with damp cloths, smooths<br />
tremors from his limbs.</p>
<p class='ml-6 italic'>I see two faces: bliss<br />
amid the scale hide<br />
and eyes that sing.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Zinc balms swathe blisters:<br />
she wraps him in swaddle;<br />
snow on a new-sown grave.</p>
<p class='ml-6 italic'>My lungs rack at<br />
each breath. She reeks<br />
of rose and soaps.</p>

<p class='mb-0'>Wires weave monitors to skin<br />
and graphs dance on screens;<br />
Her claw rests on his brow.</p>
<p class='ml-6 italic'>Cool, she is; calm.<br />
I am at her mercy<br />
and all is good.</p>

<p>She slips away and a machine<br />
wails an escape: his crisp<br />
flesh shackle falls still.</p>
